## Background and Problem Statement 
#### 两相流的背景，计算难点。
The two-phase flow is involved in many important industrial problems. For example, nuclear reactors use water to remove heat from the reactor core using two-phase flow. Two-phase flows are challenging to study from mathematical modeling and numerical algorithmic points of view.

For mathematical modeling, there are two main approaches to simulating two-phase flow: interface tracking and interface capturing methods.

For numerical algorithm to compute Navier-Stockes equation, finite difference method, finite volume method, and finite element method.



There are different ways to calculate two phase flow.
