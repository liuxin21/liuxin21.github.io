Elliptic PDEs govern steady-state equilibrium problems, which are boundary-value problems in closed domains. Consequently, elliptic PDEs are solved numerically by **relaxation methods**. As shownin Section III.5, problems governedby elliptic PDEshave no real characteristic paths. Physically, this meansthat there are no preferred paths of informationpropagationand that the domainof dependence and the range of influence of every point is the entire solution domain.Thesolution at every point dependson the solution at all other points, including the boundaries of the solution domain,andthe solution at everypoint influencesthe solution at all other points. Thesolution is continuousthroughoutthe solution domainsince there are no paths along which the derivatives of the solution maybe discontinuous. These general features of elliptic PDEsare illustrated in Figure9.4.
