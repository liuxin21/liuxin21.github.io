summary

Thenumericalsolutionof elliptic partial differential equationsbyfinite differencemethods is discussed in this chapter. Elliptic PDEsgovern equilibrium problems, whichhave no preferred paths of information propagation. The domain of dependence and range of influence of every point is the entire closed solution domain.Suchproblemsare solved numerically by relaxation methods. The two-dimensional Laplace equation is considered 
as the modelelliptic PDEin this chapter.  
Finite difference methods,as typified bythe five-point method,yield a systemof 
finite difference equations, called the systemequation, whichmustbe solved by relaxation methods.Thesuccessive-over-relaxation (SOR)methodis generally the methodof choice. Themultigrid method(Brandt, 1977)showsthe best potential for rapid convergence. 
Nonlinearpartial differential equations yield nonlinear finite difference equations. Systemsof nonlinear FDEscan be extremely difficult to solve. The multigrid methodcan
