The finite difference method is a numerical procedure which solves a PDE by **discretizing the continuous physical domain into a discrete finite difference grid**, approximating the individual exact partial derivatives in the PDE by algebraic **finite difference approximations (FDAs)**, substituting the FDAs into the PDE to obtain an algebraic **finite difference equation (FDE)**, and solving the resulting algebraic finite difference equations (FDEs) for the **dependent variable**. 以后我们都会用”FDE”来代替 “finite difference equation”. Some general characteristics of finite difference grids and finite difference approximations for equilibrium problems governed by elliptic PDEs are discussed in this section.
