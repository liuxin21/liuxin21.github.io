## Intro
这个系列主要讲解用 finite difference methods 来解 partial differential equations.

PDE的三种分类：elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic.

两种类型物理问题：equilibrium and propagation problems.

## GENERALFEATURES OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
eg:

Laplace equation: $f_{xx} + f_{yy} = 0$

one-dimensional diffusion equation: $f_t = \alpha f_{xx}$

one-dimensional wave equation: $f_{tt} = c^2 f_{xx}$
