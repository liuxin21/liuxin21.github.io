unsteady one-dimensional heat diffusion equation: 

a combined convection-diffusion problem, which is governed by the convection-diffusion equation. 

A wide variety of parabolic partial differential equations are encountered in engineering and science. Two of the more commonones are the diffusion equation and the convection-diffusion equation 

$\alpha$ 是 diffusivity

$u$是 convection velocity

The diffusion equation applies to problems in mass diffusion, heat diffusion (i.e., conduction), neutron diffusion, etc. The 
convection-diffusion equation applies to problems in which convection occurs in combination with diffusion, for example,fluid mechanics and heat transfer. 

two boundary conditions are required 

## GENERAL FEATURES OF PARABOLIC PDEs 

Propagation problems are **initial-boundary-value problems** in **open domains** (open with respect to time or a time-like variable) 

Propagation problems are governed by parabolic or hyperbolic partial differential equations. 

problems governed by parabolic PDEs have an **infinite physical information propagation speed**. As a result, the solution at a given point P at time level n depends on the solution **at all other points** in the solution domain **at all times preceding** and including time level n, and the solution at a given point P at time level n influences the solution at all other points in the solution domain at all times including and after time level n. Consequently,the physical information propagation speed c = dx/dt is infinite.
