unsteady one-dimensional heat diffusion equation: 

a combined convection-diffusion problem, which is governed by the convection-diffusion equation. 

A wide variety of parabolic partial differential equations are encountered in engineering and science. Two of the more commonones are the diffusion equation and the convection-diffusion equation 

$\alpha$ 是 diffusivity

$u$是 convection velocity

The diffusion equation applies to problems in mass diffusion, heat diffusion (i.e., conduction), neutron diffusion, etc. The 
convection-diffusion equation applies to problems in which convection occurs in combination with diffusion, for example,fluid mechanics and heat transfer.
