# Libraries

Python 有着许多 **packages or libraries** ，它们提供了许多有用的东西，比如array operations, plotting functions, and much more. 我们能导入(import)  libraries of functions to expand the capabilities of Python in our programs.

现在我们从导入一些 libraries 开始。First: our favorite library is **NumPy**, providing a bunch of useful array operations (similar to MATLAB). We will use it a lot! The second library we need is **Matplotlib**, a 2D plotting library which we will use to plot our results. The following code will be at the top of most of your programs, so execute this cell first:

	import numpy                 # we import the array library
	from matplotlib import pyplot    # import plotting library
