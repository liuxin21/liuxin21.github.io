## In Unsteady DPM: 
It is very expensive to track each individual particle in a particle flow system. Instead of tracking each particle, FLUENT tracks Parcel. Parcel contains **particles with same properties including diameter, velocity and position.** The behavior of each parcel is determined by the behavior of the particles inside. Fluent tracks parcels and number of particles in a parcel can be obtained using macro p->number\_in\_parcel. The number of particles in each parcel can be a fractional number.

Streams are defined for injecting the parcels in the computational domain. `N` streams means `N` locations of parcel injection

Stream mass flow rate, and number of particles in a parcel are related as:
Number of particles in a parcel = 
$$
\frac{Stream mass flow rate*Injection time interval}{Mass of single particle}
$$

Number of particle streams: the number of parcels that get injected after each injection time interval.


## In Steady DPM: 
Number of particles in parcel is not valid for steady tracking. Instead there is "strength" which is essentially number particles in parcel / second and is calculated as:
Strength = (Stream mass flow rate)/(Mass of single particle)


## Clarification: 
FLUENT user`s documentation mentions "particles" everywhere, when it should be actually parcels.
